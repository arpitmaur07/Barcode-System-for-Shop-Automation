<p align="center">Welcome to the Barcode System for Show Billing Automation project! This project is designed to automate the show billing system using barcode scanning technology. The system is built using Python, the ZBar barcode scanning library, and a MySQL database.

With this system, users can easily show all products present in the MySQL database, show a product by ID or by scanning the barcode, add new products by scanning their barcode, delete products, and update product details. By automating the show billing system, this project aims to reduce errors, increase productivity, and save time for both businesses and customers.</p>


<h2 align="center">Getting Started ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 and MySQL installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following Python modules:-</p>
- OpenCV <br>
- NumPy <br> 
- pyzbar <br> 
- mysql-connector-python <br> 

<br>

<p > You can install these modules using pip by running the following command:-</p> 
<code align="center" > pip install opencv-python mysql-connector-python numpy pyzbar</code> <br>
<p>Once you have installed these modules and set up a MySQL database with the relevant product details, you can clone the repository and run the <code>main.py</code> file to start using the barcode system.</p>

<h3 align="center">Usage ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h3>
<p>To use the barcode system tool, simply run the <code>main.py</code> file. The system will prompt you to select an option from the following:-</p>
- Show all products. <br>
- Show product by ID or by scanning the barcode. <br> 
- Add new product by scanning its barcode. <br> 
- Delete product by scanning its barcode. <br> 
- Update product details by its barcode. <br> 

<br>
<p>Depending on your selection, the system will ask you to enter additional information or scan a barcode. The system will then perform the corresponding action and display the relevant product details.</p>
